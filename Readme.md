  <h3 align="center">Black Friday Sale Analysis</h3>


  <p align="center">
    This is Final Capstone Project for ALY6000 22821 Introduction to Data Analytics Winter 2021 CPS. <br>It is primarily to introduce and learn Data Analytics and Descriptive using R.
    <br />This paper summarizes our preliminary (Exploratory Data Analysis EDA) analysis on the selected dataset, the Black friday Dataset from Amazon for this group project. It shared some insightful results from the EDA and descriptive statistics. Further, this paper identifies a set of analysis used to answer the business questions on the dataset and justifies those findings.

### Direct Questions that can be framed are

Based on the data- we can create data that are understandable for a human eye are
1.	Age
2.	Gender
3.	Occupation- we can try
4.	City category
5.	Marital status

### Rest of the variables are high in numbers and we would be needing more data. On the outlook we can create question and visualizations on the above-mentioned variables

## Questions: 

1.	Number of purchases based on the age
1.	Number of purchases made based on the marital status
1.	We can do the plots age and marital status
1.	Number of purchases based on the city category- arrange is descending order
1.	Number of purchases based on the gender and  age
1.	Plot purchases based on the gender and age
1.	Plot on gender, marital status, and age
1.	We can make plot based on the purchases based on occupation, say we arrange the occupation and purchase in descending order, we can assume with more purchases will be having better income- have top 5 spenders
1.	Based on gender we can bifurcate the product categories- particular product categories bought by males and females- we can do it by arranging them in descending order
1.	Based on this we can have target ads

<p align="justify">
Just to get started, we had business study, once we did it, we analyzed that we can create more insights based on the above data. If anyone has different approach, we can try that as well and come up with visualizations.
